# Exercise 4.6 Door

Create a class named `Door`. The door does not have any variables. Create for it a constructor with no parameters (or use the default constructor). After that, create a `def knock()` method for the door that prints the message "Who's there?" when called.

The door should work as follows.

```python
alexander = Door()

print(alexander.knock())
print(alexander.knock())
```

```plaintext
Who's there?
Who's there?
```
